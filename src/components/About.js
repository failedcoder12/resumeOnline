                    Hi, my name is James Grant, Iâ€™m a full stack web developer with over 8 years experience currently specialising in React development. I am currently working for NatWest as a frontend software engineer on their comercial banking platform, Bankline.
                    I enjoy making clean and interactive UI that is quick and easy to use whilst also giving users an enjoyable experience. I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. The things that I currently have the most experience working with are:
                    <Badge variant="secondary">React</Badge>,<Badge variant="secondary">C++</Badge>.
                </div>
            </Col>
            <Col md={2}></Col>
            </Row>
        </div>
    );
};
